The Spider Queen,Паучья королева,712,4.78,https://www.webnovel.com/book/the-spider-queen_16552577206472505,"In the Year 30XX......

Humans have long been discovering the wonders of the universe and exploring the great galaxies beyond the milky way.

They are not alone.

The universe is primal and untamed with civilisations pitted against one another in battles to decided life and death.

Mankind is one of the weakest races but have discovered cultivation techniques that morph their bodies and grant them unimaginable power.

Sui Meng was just an ordinary girl who woke up in the body of  sixteen year old Sophie Peterlor.

Sophie is the half human hybrid of a prestigious duke house but faces discrimination based on her racial heritage and apparent lack of cultivation talent.

This changes when Sophie discovers a cultivation manual hidden in the necklace given by her late mother.

Elena Lee has a unique ability. She remembers everything she saw or heard at least once. Be it people, things or places. Her memory is like a puzzle the fragments of which are growing day by day whether the girl wants it or not.

She doesn't know where this ability came from. Her first memories start at the age of 6 when she was adopted by a rich man, the head of the big pharmaceutical company. For many years she was trying to find something about her real parents but all in vain.

Elena wants to find this piece of memory but she doesn't know that the missing fragment is in the hands of a man who is following her from the shadows.

He knows her past. He owns the key to her future. 
He wants to get the sacred knowledge hidden inside Elena's head even the girl herself doesn't know about. 
He wants her. 
But it's impossible to get both.

And he has to make a choice. The Master.

ryuxenji the translator here. :3 Here are some other things you should know:
 
1) This story is NOT primarily a romance. QI's system right now categorizes all novels taken from the female novel Chinese site (起点女生网) as 'romance' without fail, regardless of whether they truly are romance. So, if you are here just for the romance, you might want to find a different novel. There will be some romance eventually, but most of this novel is Sci-Fi/Xianxia with a lot of world-building and character development.
 
2) I use British spelling. So, please ensure spelling errors are really errors before reporting them.
 
3) No matter what the release rate up top says, the guaranteed release rate right now is 1 chp/day (a.k.a. 7 chps/week). All else is extra at my discretion. (I'll try my best, but RL responsibilities come first.)"
